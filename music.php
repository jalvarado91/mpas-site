              Play drums and have fun! Group drumming class for students 10 & up who may not be able to find time for practicing an instrument but really love music and want to play a drum! Students will not need to own a drum. Drums and percussion instruments will be provided. These players will learn how to hold their hands in ways that will change the sound of the drum. They will learn patterns, dynamics, history and rhythms from countries all over the world. As they grow together they will be able to explore more difficult hand percussion and rhythms. Students who attain a certain level will be able to join the Rhythm Rebels Percussion Ensemble.

              This is the next level of playing and will introduce the concepts of space, syncopation, odd meter, and basic polyrhythm ideas. We will also introduce the concept of layering parts across the drum section. Students will learn to stay focused on their own part while hearing different drum patterns being played at the same time.

              Have fun and accelerate your learning! This class is an introduction to rhythm. Everyone should take this one semester class. Musicians will learn rhythmic concepts faster and dancers will be able to learn choreography faster and understand the special relationship between music and movement. This class is based on concepts from Eurythmics and Glen Velez's Handance method using the concept of synchronization between the drum, the voice, and body movement.
