              This confidence building class develops the voice as students work in an ensemble setting and motor skills in an hour long class. One half hour of the class will be working on vocals either unison or harmonies. The second half hour will take the vocals they are working on and put it on it’s feet, learning patterns,and spacial awareness as well as developing performance skills. Some parts of the class may be developing and playing  acting games to open the student up to improvisation and creative moments. It’s a great way to begin the journey into theatre, music , dance or public speaking!
