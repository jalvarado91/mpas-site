              Basic Ballet fundamentals for the beginner dancer. Broadway
              dancers still need a classical foundation therefore the  class
              begins with the ballet barre, learning vocabulary and working on
              correcting body alignment. We then take the barre into the center
              of the room and across the floor.  We end the class by working on
              a small combination developing the ability to connect the steps
              using clear transitions and  challenging your memory. This is also
              a time to begin to work on performance skills. Students progress
              to the next level when they have developed a good understanding
              for basic ballet technique.
