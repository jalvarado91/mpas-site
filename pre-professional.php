              This class is for students who are interested in being trained in all the necessary disciplines that are required for Musical Theater performance. Students must be accepted into this program through teacher evaluation and are required to attend Ballet for Broadway, Broadway Jazz, Step Into Time, Private Voice and the Friday night Pre-Professsional class which is dedicated to skill building. The Pre- Professional class involves acting, singing, dancing, music theory and performance techniques. If you are in a magnet program, "Thespians" or just plain love to sing, dance or act, the Pre Professional Track is a perfect place to get serious and develop the skills  needed to advance your talents! Throughout the year this group will be performing in a variety of venues and events in the area. If you are interested in being part of the Pre-Professional Performers, contact Julie or Matt .
