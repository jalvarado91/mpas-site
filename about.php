            “My teaching philosophy is based on personal growth and
            development, where the student is offered a creative outlet
            where they can express themselves and develop self-
            confidence. I help them confront their fears and encourage
            them to make their own decisions. This, therefore, helps
            the student not only learn about him or herself as a singer,
            but as a person as well. Additionally, as much as I care
            about their personal development, I am also committed to
            providing a high quality music education experience.”
