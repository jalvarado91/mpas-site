              Basic Ballet fundamentals for the beginner dancer. Broadway
              dancers still need a classical foundation therefore the  class
              begins with the ballet barre, learning vocabulary and working on
              correcting body alignment. We then take the barre into the center
              of the room and across the floor.  We end the class by working on
              a small combination developing the ability to connect the steps
              using clear transitions and  challenging your memory. This is also
              a time to begin to work on performance skills. Students progress
              to the next level when they have developed a good understanding
              for basic ballet technique.

              Beginners work for approx 45 mins strengthening their core, stretching the body and working on technique which are translated into the movements across the floor. You learn basic terminology stemming from ballet along with Jazz styles and lines of the body. Across the floor will be a series of  the basic progressive movements such as leaps and turns. The last half hour will be dedicated to a style of dance known on Broadway. Every few weeks we begin a new style introducing a different genre to your dance. Students are recommended to take a basic ballet or Floor-Barre class in order to advance more quickly and understand basic body alignment such as the parallel and turned out positions.

              Students perform basic ballet movement while lying  on the floor guided by verbal instruction and imagery. Dancers, non-dancers and  children gain strength and knowledge for proper alignment. The work is slow and deliberate so you can work carefully and precisely to perfect each movement. Correct patterns of movement become muscular memory without fighting the pull of gravity or bearing the body’s weight. Incorrect muscular patterns are replaced with corrected alignment and then are reinforced in a standing position either at the barre or center work.
